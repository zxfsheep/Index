* [Advanced Machine Learning](https://github.com/zxfsheep/advanced-machine-learning/blob/master/README.md) holds my projects and notes for advanced machine learning techniques.
* [Machine learning random ideas](https://github.com/zxfsheep/ML-random-ideas/blob/master/README.md) is to drop new ideas that I came up with while practicing data science and machine learning.
* [Machine learning building blocks](https://github.com/zxfsheep/ML-building-blocks/blob/master/README.md) is to record my codes for future use in data science and machine learning projects, with comments and details.
* [This is my TensorFlow implementation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zxfsheep/BayesianNet/blob/master/Bayes_test.ipynb) of computing marginal joint distribution of Bayesian Networks, in an attempt to explore parametric identifiability of graphical models.
